# Conclusion

As of me writing this, I've never made it to the position of manager. I've futility tried, but ran up against fear from others and fear from myself.

The fear from others was a simple concern that I have "no experience" as a manager. This is true, although I don't know how I'm supposed to gain that experience without actually being one.

But I've written about it. I've read about it. I've had countless conversations about it. I've done pretty much everything you can do besides actually be a manager.

Regardless of my opinion on that matter, there is that other fear I mentioned, the one hiding inside me. This is the fear that says, "You won't be good as a manager. You'll make mistakes and be seen as a fraud."

Oh how powerful that fear is.

How do you overcome it? How do you be the perfect manager, knowing that you're human, biased and all?

The answer is, you don't.

A great manager isn't someone who always gets it right. Rather, it's someone who searches for where they got it wrong. They know that their view is limited, that their experiences are skewed, and that each person working under their supervision has needs that the manager simply can't provide for.

It's only by being honest, transparent and trusting that someone can manifest the ideal "great manager".

There's no single process that will solve all problems. You're always trading off one benefit or drawback for another. If Thomas Jefferson said "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty", then I say "Eternal scrutiny is the price of great management."

As I said in the introduction, you're already there. Not that you can't improve, but that constant improvement is the finale. There's nothing beyond that. You're either improving, or your dead; there is no pinnacle where you've perfected it all.

I'll leave you with the words of the great Ms. Frizzle, "Take Chances, Make Mistakes, Get Messy!"

Thank you, kind reader.
