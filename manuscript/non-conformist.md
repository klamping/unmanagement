-# Part I - Unmanagement

# The Non-Conformist Leader

I have a theory about management. Really, it's more like a law that I'd like to propose:

> The natural tendency of a developing organization is to increase bureaucracy.

In other words, as management structure is being established, the conventional choice always leads to more Process. This is similar to [The Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle#Iron_Law_of_Bureaucracy), except that it's not an "Iron Law".

With the right actions, we can avoid this default path. We can head a different way, to a better place. A direction that doesn't end up with layers of middle management and [disengaged employees](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/gallup-employee-engagement-survey-managers/).

The right leader, the "Non-conformist Leader", has certain traits that keep them from falling back to [the conventional workplace of The Office](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/).

Here's what I propose those traits are:

- They foster disagreement
- They're overly transparent
- They use failure to learn
- They don't fret the numbers

and finally:

- They're human

Let's take these one by one.

## They Foster Disagreement

Ed Catmull, the founder and current President of Pixar, writes about [how disagreement is essential to finding truly creative solutions](https://hbr.org/2008/09/how-pixar-fosters-collective-creativity). He goes in to depth about it in his fantastic book, [Creativity, Inc](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FUZQYBO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FUZQYBO&linkCode=as2&tag=cibomediserv-20&linkId=7LWYEJVMEYUGOCI5):

> What makes Pixar special is that we acknowledge we will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it.

Non-conformist leaders are not only open to critical feedback, they actively seek it out. They understand that people often withhold criticism, as it's usually safer to stay quiet than to stand up for a contrary view.

They purposefully promote a culture that fosters disagreement, as [fighting for our ideas makes them better](http://99u.com/articles/7224/why-fighting-for-our-ideas-makes-them-better). They understand that [the best have to fight](http://blog.kevinlamping.com/the-best-fight/) in order to be the best.

A great leader doesn't have a secret handbook they follow to make the right decisions. They grow a team that's not afraid to speak up, then they listen in as the team makes the right decision for them.

## They Default to Transparency

[The folks at Buffer have raised the bar in terms of transparency](https://buffer.com/transparency). Their culture motto of "Default to Transparency" changes the way 

Work in the open

Managers are afraid to reveal too much too early...



## They Accept Failure

Many leaders think it's their job to remove risk. It seems like the logical approach; they're there to ensure the success of a project.

However, there is a hidden opportunity cost to always being the one with the right answer. You're simply not allowing your rising leaders the chance to learn and gain experience through failure.

The non-conformist leader allows room for failure. They allow decisions to be made that they think are wrong. They don't allow catastrophic failure, but they are open to small losses. 

It's fairly easy to replace a low-level employee. Yes, it costs some HR resources and takes time in training, but 3 months later everything should be running smoothly.

On the other hand, true leaders are much more difficult to find, and replace a leader is very costly if no one from within the organization is ready. When a leader moves on (they always will) it can be years before the organization returns back to a productive state.

Be ready for the next organizational transformation by being open to employee growth, which often comes as the result of failure.

Not only to non-conformist leaders allow for failure, [they celebrate it](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-ceo-failure-idUSKBN0HC16N20140917). They understand that failure is uncomfortable and most would prefer to avoid it, which eventually leads to the stagnation of ideas.

By celebrating failure, they push employees to take risks that would otherwise be too much


## They Don't Fret the Numbers

## They're Human

Most of all, most important, great leaders are human.
