# The Non-Conformist Leader

I have a theory about management. Really, it's more like a law that I'd like to propose:

> The natural tendency of a growing hierarchy is to increase bureaucracy.

In other words, when faced with a decision, the conventional choice will always lead to more process. This is similar to [The Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle#Iron_Law_of_Bureaucracy), except that it's not an "Iron Law".

With the right actions, we can avoid this default path. We can head a different way, to a better place. A direction that doesn't end up with layers of middle management and [disengaged employees](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/gallup-employee-engagement-survey-managers/).

The right leader, the "Non-conformist Leader", has certain traits that keep them from [the conventional workplace of The Office](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/). Here's what I think those traits are.

## They Foster Disagreement

Ed Catmull, the founder and current President of Pixar, writes about [how disagreement is essential to finding truly creative solutions](https://hbr.org/2008/09/how-pixar-fosters-collective-creativity). He writes about it again in his fantastic book, [Creativity, Inc](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FUZQYBO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FUZQYBO&linkCode=as2&tag=cibomediserv-20&linkId=7LWYEJVMEYUGOCI5):

> What makes Pixar special is that we acknowledge we will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it.

Non-conformist leaders not only are open to controversial feedback, they seek it out. They understand that it's easier to withhold a contrary view than to stand up for it. They purposefully seek out and promote a culture that fosters disagreement, as [fighting for our ideas makes them better](http://99u.com/articles/7224/why-fighting-for-our-ideas-makes-them-better).

I go in to further detail in "[The Best Fight](http://blog.kevinlamping.com/the-best-fight/)", which I'd love for you to read.

## They Let People Fail

Many leaders think it's their job to remove risk. It seems like the logical approach; they're there to ensure the success of a project.

However, there is a hidden opportunity cost to always being the one with the right answer. You're simply not allowing your rising leaders the chance to learn and gain experience through failure.

The non-conformist leader allows room for failure. They allow decisions to be made that they think are wrong. They don't allow catastrophic failure, but they are open to small losses. 

It's fairly easy to replace a low-level employee. Yes, it costs some HR resources and take time in training, but 3 months later everything should be running smoothly.

On the other hand, true leaders are much more difficult to find, and replace a leader is very costly if no one from within the organization is ready. When a leader moves on (they always will) it can be years before the organization returns back to a productive state.

Be ready for the next organizational transformation by being open to employee growth, which often comes at the result of failure.

## They Celebrate Failure

Not only to non-conformist leaders allow for failure, [they celebrate it](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-ceo-failure-idUSKBN0HC16N20140917). They understand that failure is uncomfortable and most would prefer to avoid it, which eventually leads to the stagnation of ideas.

By celebrating failure, they push employees to take risks that would otherwise be too much

## They're Overly Transparent



## They Don't Worry About Results


## They're Human
