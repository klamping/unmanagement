# 0% Productivity

How can I get the most uselessness out of my day?

I thought about this question shortly before quitting a job I had at a large company. There were several reasons to quit, but gridlock due to poor processes was the biggest. Out of frustration, I started listing out habits we had as a company that kept actual work from getting done. 

I called it my "0% Productivity" list.

I wasn't looking to call anyone out by name. We all have habits that slow others down. I just think the best way to overcome them is to speak honestly and openly about ways to improve.

These next four essays are from this list. They're a bit tongue-in-cheek, as the writing style pokes fun at the subject.

I intend to continue writing on the top, as I know many more ways to drag employee productivity down the drain. For now though, these four will have to do.
