A few years ago I began writing about management, although I've never actually been a manager.

I didn't intend to become so interested in it. I didn't like management; it always seemed to get in the way; dictating how things were to be done.

I couldn't understand why someone would want to be a manager. To me, you traded in actual productive work for days of mindlessly balancing budgets and creating stuffy PowerPoint presentations.

something changed along the way

became more interested in the human aspect

growing people, teaching, finding others

Great books:
- Creativity, Inc
- Motivation

Great podcasts:
- Safety moment

It's been risky writing about management. I usually have a reason for writing what I do, as it's usually relevant to recent events.
