# Preface

In the summer of 2013, I began to write about Managers. Not that I had any experience being one, but I certainly had felt the impact of them, both positive and negative.

To be honest, I'm wary of most management; I've seen and felt the frustration caused by those who manage poorly. Even those who mean their best seem to struggle with implementing what they believe.

For a long time, I couldn't understand why someone would want to be a manager. To me, it meant trading in actual productive work for days of mindlessly balancing budgets and creating stuffy PowerPoint presentations.

Then I realized there was another side to it, a human side. One focused on growing people, teaching and mentoring them so they can achieve their best. People whose passion is finding the passion that lives inside others and igniting it.

I began to devour books on the subject. *Creativity, Inc*, *The Year Without Pants*, and *Joy at Work*, to name a few. I was captivated with how much better we could be treating each others as humans working together. 

At the same time, I began filling up my podcast queue with great shows like [the Pre-Accident Investigation Podcast](http://preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com/), [the Work Talk Show](http://worktalkshow.com/) and [the Future of Work Podcast](https://thefutureorganization.com/future-work-podcast/).

With so much great input coming in, I felt the urge to write my own kind of content. I can't claim to bring anything new to the table with what I've said, but I do deeply believe in everything I write.

I believe managers should act like coaches, that proper recognition should take effort, and most importantly, that we'd live happier, more meaningful lives, if we'd only understand that companies are just a complex orchestra of humans, brought together to improve our short time on this planet.

If you're reading this book, you're already a non-conformist leader.  Not because I have anything particularly insightful to say, but because you're looking for answers to questions you haven't asked. You're not content with the traditional role of boss, and you know that the job can mean so much more.

Thank you for reading. Truly. You're devotion to making the lives of those who follow you better will be felt far and wide.
