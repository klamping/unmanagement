# Preface

A few years ago I began writing about management, although I've never been a manager.

I didn't intend to become so interested in it. I didn't like management; always getting in the way and dictating how things were done.

I couldn't see why someone would want to become a manager. It seemed like you traded in actual productive work for mindlessly balancing budgets and creating stuffy PowerPoint presentations.

something changed along the way

became more interested in the human aspect

growing people, teaching, finding others

Great books:
- Creativity, Inc
- Motivation

Great podcasts:
- Safety moment

It's been risky writing about management. I usually have a reason for writing what I do, and it's usually relavant to recent events.
