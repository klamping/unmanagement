# Preface

A few years ago I began writing about management, although I've never actually been a manager. I didn't intend to become so interested in it. I didn't like management; it always seemed to get in the way; dictating how things were to be done.

I couldn't understand why someone would want to be a manager. To me, you traded in actual productive work for days of mindlessly balancing budgets and creating stuffy PowerPoint presentations.

Then I realized there was another side to management. A human side. One focused on growing people, teaching and mentoring, finding the passion that lives inside others and igniting it.

I began to devour books on the subject. *Creativity, Inc*, *The Year Without Pants*, and *Joy at Work*, to name a few. I was captivated with how much better we could be treating each others  as humans working together. 

At the same time, I began filling up my podcast queue with great shows like [the Pre-Accident Investigation Podcast](http://preaccidentpodcast.podbean.com/), [the Work Talk Show](http://worktalkshow.com/) and [the Future of Work Podcast](https://thefutureorganization.com/future-work-podcast/).

With so much great input coming in, I was bound to want to write my own kind of output. I can't claim to bring anything new to the table with what I write, but I do believe in everything I've written.

I believe managers should act like coaches, that proper recognition should be hard to do, and most importantly, that we'd live richer, fuller lives if we realized that companies are a complex orchestra of human lives.
